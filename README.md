# asimpleforum

**A Simple Forum** is an open source forum package built using **NodeJS** and **SailsJS**.

It is still in the very early stages of development but, once complete (or at a stable state), you will be able to download the package and install your own forum.

Requirements
===
NodeJS
A good browser (so long IE)

Next release
===
The following are planned for the next release (date tbc)

- Search feature (users and topics/posts
- Online list for logged in users
- Notifications for post replies and followers
- Post reporting
- Post quoting
- MARKDOWN for posts

These aren't in any specific order but they are (what I judge) to be the most important features for the next release.

Known Issues
===

**A Simple Forum** was designed using the most modern technologies. Because of this certain older browsers will have reduced features available to them. So far this includes andything to do with uploading files.
